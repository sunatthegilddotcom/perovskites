### Overview:
Develop a python package that can extract hidden information from spatial heterogeneities observed in PL images of perovskite thin films and quantify it to generate features for use in lifetime prediction models. Currently, PL image processing is primarily implemented in biological fields; we seek to restructure this technology for use in the material characterization of perovskite photovoltaics. This will provide a more robust picture of features which lead to degradation than current state of the art perovskite characterization. 

### Potential Users:
* Other academic researchers in the thin-film PV community
* Research testbeds
* Solar-cell manufacturers

### Use Cases:
*Primary:*
* Predict lifetime of a perovskite (Ld75) for a perovskite based on early timeseries (spatial AIPL) data
* Enchance the rate of testing for thin-film PV
* Check for correlation between PL and diffusion length in perovskites

*Secondary:*
* Through correlating features to film lifetime, determine how to manufacture an optimally stable thin-film
* Extract spatial PL features from images to be fed into a linear regression model for Ld75 prediction
* Extract information for the PL images correlated to manufacturing processes

### Instructions:
* Check the [notebooks/visualize_PL_data.ipynb](notebooks/visualize_PL_data.ipynb) notebook.
* To use the data, first install [Git Large-File-Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com). When you pull the repo and find that the `data/example.zip` is only of 1kB, try these two commands after `git pull origin main`- 
```
git lfs fetch
git lfs checkout
```

* Currently, the plan is to use a shared Google Drive to store all data and use it in the model. Also, we must make sure that the data is openly available to everyone once the repo is made public.
