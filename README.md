## Decoding spatial heterogeneities in Photoluminiscence images in Perovskite Thin films

### Goals:
Develop a package that can extract hidden information from spatial heterogeneities observed in PL images of perovskite thin films and quantify it to generate features for use in lifetime prediction models.

1. Create a python package that implements image-processing techniques to pre-process widefield PL image data and extract features to be used in a ML model.
2. Using a CNN on widefield AIPL images directly to predict lifetime of a perovskite (Ld75) for a perovskite and also check for correlation between PL and diffusion length in perovskites. 3. Using an autoencoder to extract spatial PL features from images to be fed into a linear regression model for Ld75 prediction.
